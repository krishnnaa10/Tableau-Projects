# HR Dashboard

The Zip folder contains the following:

Project Data – The data used in this HR Dashboard project is generated using a combination of ChatGPT prompts and the Python Faker library. This dataset simulates a set of employee information typically found in HR systems, including demographics, job details, salary, performance evaluations, and attrition data. The generated data is designed to mimic real-world HR data, providing a rich dataset for analysis and visualization in Tableau.

Icons & Images – The icons used in the HR Dashboard are sourced from Flaticon and customized using Photopea to match the dashboard’s color scheme. The PDS (Photopea files) can be found in the icon folder of the zip file for further editing if needed.

Tableau Project File – The project file created during the course can be found in Zip file. You can also directly download the Tableau file from my Tableau Public Profile.

## Summary View

The summary view should be divided into three main sections: Overview, Demographics, and Income Analysis

+ Display the total number of hired employees, active employees, and terminated employees.
+ Visualize the total number of hired and terminated employees over the years.
+ Present a breakdown of total employees by department and job titles.
+ Compare total employees between headquarters (HQ) and branches (New York is the HQ)
+ Show the distribution of employees by city and state.

#### Demographics

The Demographics section should offer insights into the composition of the workforce, including:

+ Present the gender ratio in the company.
+ Visualize the distribution of employees across age groups and education levels.
+ Show the total number of employees within each age group.
+ Show the total number of employees within each education level.
+ Present the correlation between employees’s educational backgrounds and their performance ratings.

#### Income

The income analysis section should focus on salary-related metrics, including:

+ Compare salaries across different education levels for both genders to identify any discrepancies or patterns.
+ Present how the age correlate with the salary for employees in each department.

## Employee Records View

+ Provide a comprehensive list of all employees with necessary information such as name, department, position, gender, age, education, and salary.
